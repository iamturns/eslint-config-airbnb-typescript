# Maintaining

This guide is intended for maintainers (anybody with commit access).

## Approving Pull Requests

1. Use "Squash and Merge". This keeps a clean history in `master`, with a full history available in Pull Requests.
1. Ensure the merge message conforms to [Conventional Commits](https://conventionalcommits.org/) spec.

## Releasing

Releasing is handled automatically by [CircleCI](https://circleci.com/) and [semantic-release](https://github.com/semantic-release/semantic-release).
